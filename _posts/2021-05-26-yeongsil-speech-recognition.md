title: "Yeongsil: An Speech Recognition"
---

This experiment inspired by one of recent korean drama, Start-Up. I'm not a fans but got some hype here because the drama is about the technology that I also studied right now. Yeongsil was a machine shaped like a wireless speaker that have a ability to recognize a voice from the user, based on the story here the user is Han Jipyeong.  

In my experiment, there was still a problem with speed performance. I think because my internet connection is not sufficiently supportive to do live machine learning, huft.
